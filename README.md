# Phase-Looping-Midi-Sequener
Midi Sequencer inspired by Steve Reich's phase looping ideas.

This midi sequencer is inspired by the ideas of Steve Reich and specifically aims to translate audio 
phase looping into midi processes. This sequencer does this via its mode ‘note select’ in which the 
user is able to select the step in the sequence that they want moved to the beginning each time it 
completes.

This device provides not only a method for sequencing, but processes to actively re-sequence and shuffle notes whilst playing, creating variation through remarkably simple movements. Creating longer evolving sequences of midi notes.
